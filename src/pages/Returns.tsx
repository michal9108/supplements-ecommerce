              It depends. Some countries are more comprehensive when it comes to
              collecting duties. Please be prepared as these are your
              responsibility if they are levied. * International shipping
              charges do not include duties. Those are the responsibility of the
              customer and will need to be collected before delivery. * In
              addition if a package is refused due to customs/duties fees and
              the product returned, any fees charged for shipping to and from
              your country for the return will be subtracted from any monies due
              on the return.
